# Add a line that prints out public key that i should add to git.

# By default, 'command' and shell tasks in Ansible are assumed to change the
# system state. "changed_when: false" - this tells Ansible that the task does
# not change the system state, and it should always report "unchanged" when this
# task is executed.

# When you use Ansible modules like shell, command, or script to execute
# commands on remote hosts, the output and other details of the command
# execution are stored in a complex data structure rather than a simple string.
# This is because Ansible provides more than just the raw output of the command;
# it also provides metadata about the execution, such as whether the command
# succeeded, its standard error output, and more.
# To access the actual output of the command, you use .stdout with the variable
# name because that's where the standard output is stored within the variable's
# data structure. If you were to reference just the name of the variable without
# .stdout, you would be referring to the entire data structure, which includes
# all the metadata mentioned above, not just the output of the command.
