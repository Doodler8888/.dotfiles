If you want to save a file, use (-o directs stdout into a file, -L handles http
redirection):
curl -Lo file-name https://www.whatever.com/path/to/something

Ignore certificates:
curl -k <url>

Check only headers (useful for testing, where the address that you use isn't
meant as a test endpoint):
curl -I <url>

Authentication test:
curl -u "<login>:<password>" -I "<url>"
