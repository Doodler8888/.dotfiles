Print out current partitions with their fs types:
df -Th | grep "^/dev"

/proc - system information, process information, provised an ability to define
system settings.

/var - logs (/var/logs), postgres files (/var/lib/posgres)

/run - probably i more direct version of /proc (in a sense that it's probably
easier to extract real time information from it). And maybe it's generally
related to runtime files. But what exactly they are in this case i don't know.

/sys - information about hardware
