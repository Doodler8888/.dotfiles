find . -maxdepth 1 -name 'your_search_pattern*' 
-- When you try to use globbing, you have to put the search pattern into single
-- quotes, otherwise it will be expanded as a list, so that a list of the found
-- items is a search pattern.


Negate:

find "$HOME"/.ssh -type f ! -name '*.pub' ! -name "config"


Gotchas:

find doesn't follow symlinks, so if you try to use 'find . -type f ! -name
"*.pub"' it wont work. Add '-L' flag.
