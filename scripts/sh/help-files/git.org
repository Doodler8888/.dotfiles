If you are in a situation where pulling from master branch caused problem and
you need to reverse the changes, do this:

git reflog

It's a powerful command that shows all you cloning, pulls and resets. Just find
the commit hash for the cloning or previous pull or whatever and use:

git reset --hard commit_hash
