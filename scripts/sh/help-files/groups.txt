Check if a group exists (only through exit code);
getent group <group_name> >/dev/null 2>&1; echo $?

Add a group to a user (the group list wont be updated even after 'exec zsh -l',
because it doesn't trigger /bin/login):
sudo usermod -aG groupname username

Load a shell with the added group:
su - <user_name>

Remove a user from a group:
(TLDR - just edit /etc/group)

Remove a group:
sudo groupdel groupname
