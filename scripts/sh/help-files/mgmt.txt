In order to pull the image you have to be logged in into the corporate registry
using 'docker login registry.***.com:5000'. Use a generated PAT for a password
or look for it in the password manager. Also, there are might be some
permissions issues and a couple of other small problems that are easy to fix.
I added '--network host' to use vpn interface. I have no idea why this flags
isn't in the instruction.

Launch mgmt container:
docker run \
  --network host \
  --cap-add ALL \
  --pull=always --rm --interactive --tty \
  --volume $HOME:/app \
  --volume $HOME/.mgmt:/home/mgmt/.mgmt \
  --volume $HOME/.ssh:/home/mgmt/.ssh \
  registry.<b***>.com:5000/sysadm/mgmt:master
