Launch service:
doas ln -s /etc/sv/service-name /var/service

Service status:
doas sv status

Servie reload:
doas sv reload

Pause a service:
doas sv pause servicename(?)

Launch once and do not restart if it stops (which is probably mean i need the
service to be in the /var/service already?):
sv once servicename(?)


Breakdown of a status output:

run: sddm: (pid 867) 812s; run: log: (pid 866) 812s

'run: sddm:' and 'run: log:' are needed to be perciveied together. Meaning that
the first one is about sddm running and the second one (run: log:) is about a
logging service running for the sddm.
