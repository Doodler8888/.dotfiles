-x: Extract files from an archive. This is essential for untar'ing.
-v: Verbose mode (same as when creating). Highly recommended.
-f: File. Specifies the archive file to extract from. Almost always required.
-z: Automatically compress or decompress using gzip (if the archive is .tar.gz
    or .tgz).
-C: Change to the specified directory before extracting. This is crucial for
    extracting to a specific location. If omitted, tar extracts to the current
    directory.

Extract (the -z flag must be before the -f flag):
tar -xzf pycharm-community-2024.3.5.tar.gz

Create a simple (uncompressed) tarball:
tar -cvf my_archive.tar file1.txt file2.txt my_directory/

Use -z flag to ... (finish, i used it trying to unzip, didn't work)
