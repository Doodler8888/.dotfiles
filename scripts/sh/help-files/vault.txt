TO USE ANY OF THI COMMANDS, YOU HAVE TO USE THE -address FLAG. IT COMES AFTER
THE MAIN SEQUENCE (e.g. 'vault policy write -address ...'). OR YOU CAN EXPORT
THE VAULT_ADDR ENV VARIABLE.

Log in:
vault login [-address <vault_address>] <root_token>

Apply policy:
vault policy write <policy_name> <path_to_policy_file>

Policy list:
vault policy list

Create a token (the -period flag is for the -renewable flag):
vault token create -policy="policy_name" -ttl="8h" -renewable=true -period="24h"

Add a secret (you have to use the path in such manner '-mount="..." "..."',
otherwise you'll get 403 error):
vault kv put -address <address> -mount="kv" "<path>" <key>=<value> \
													 <key>=<value> \
													 <key>=<value>
